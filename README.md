# Alcoholic-EEG-Classifier

We were interested in predicting whether a subject is an alcoholic or not based off of this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database. The main problem is that alcoholism is currently and has been a prevalent issue for people due to not only detrimental health effects but also interfering with a personâ€™s ability to work, form and maintain relationships, and live an overall healthy and happy life. Naturally, we want to do more research into how and why people are more predisposed to becoming alcoholics so that we can mitigate this problem and create beneficial solutions for future generations. This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism which we are going to use to create a model which predicts whether or not a subject is an alcoholic.
